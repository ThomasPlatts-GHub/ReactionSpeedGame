Reaction Speed Game made with an Arduino

# Project Info
This is my very first project with an Arduino since getting the device on 17th Sept 2025. I am very proud with how far i have come in such a short amount of time.<br>
I have not made the wiring clear i am aware of this and will do better in my next project by planning ahead and understanding to make this a priority so it is easier for me and others to understand what goes where.<br>
Other than this, my first project is very basic and i hope to make some more advanced ones in the future soon to come.
